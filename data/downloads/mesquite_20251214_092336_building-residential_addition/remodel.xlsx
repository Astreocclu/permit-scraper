A community event sponsored by some of the residents in Mesquite who have been sewing face mask for First Responders and healthcare workers. There will be no extra equipment other than the use of the Pavilion. And use of the electrical outlets for keeping food hot. We will be serving homemade and pre-packaged barbecue sandwiches ,chips and beans along with canned sodas and bottled water. It is our intention to hand out 150 to 200 face masks to all residents who come who have not yet received a face mask. This will be open to the public so I do not know how many may attend. There will be approximately 15-25 volunteer workers wearing gloves and face mask and passing out food and drinks. We will abide by the 6-foot social distancing rule and will have lines marked off for people to stop by pick up their food and a face mask and then go on about their way through the park.

At this time we will have a radio and small sound system playing music. If we have a band to volunteer their time for the afternoon, I will demand this permit request to include the use of a band. Otherwise, at this time, we will have music playing but only within earshot of the Pavilion."
