We received a notification from the local utility company Oncor indicating that your enrollment order for connection at 2 Secluded Pond Cv., Princeton, TX 75407 was rejected because an electrical inspection permit is being required by the city of Princeton.

Please note that the order will remain on hold with the local utility company for twenty calendar days pending receipt of the permit. If the permit is received within those twenty days, the order will automatically be released and worked by Oncor. If it takes longer than twenty days for the permit to be received, then Constellation will need to be contacted to resubmit the request for service connection. 

We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. If you have any questions or concerns regarding the need for a permit, please feel free to contact Oncor at 888-313-6862.
